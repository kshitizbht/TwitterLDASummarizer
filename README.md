Tweet Clustering and Summarizing using LDA (College Project)


I did this as a college project where we try to use LDA (latent dirichlet allocation), which is an unsupervised machine learning techniques, to cluster tweets by topic and summarize each cluster by picking the top representative tweet.

This was a fun college project. Currently I am finding all my old code and converting them to github and hopefully make them run so someone can use it.

1. For paper details see DM_TweetsClusteringUsingLDA.pdf
2. For testing out the code, well i haven't worked on it for a long time but will try to set it up again and put the entire procedure here.
